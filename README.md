# json-resume
Resume generator.


In a nutshell, this repo is based on [json-resume](https://jsonresume.org/), and [resumed cli](https://github.com/rbardini/resumed) which generates a resume with different themes given a predefined schema. It's really easy to change themes, checkout [themes](themes.md) for instructions. 

Different resume versions are found in the jsons folder. 

The generated resume will be called `resume.html`, and `index.html` will be a clone to allow github pages deployment for free hosting.

Another advantage of json-resume, is taking advantage of free hosting if you have a public gist called `resume.json`. See your resume at:

https://registry.jsonresume.org/zapidan you can add a `theme` parameter to automatically switch [supported themes](https://registry.jsonresume.org/themes)

Ex:
https://registry.jsonresume.org/zapidan?theme=macchiato
https://registry.jsonresume.org/zapidan?theme=flat
https://registry.jsonresume.org/zapidan?theme=professional
https://registry.jsonresume.org/zapidan?theme=elegant
